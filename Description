# Programmer-Clicker
A meta clicker game that I'm currently working on. Doesn't currently have a live link, as it is in development. However, you can expect me to add one eventually.

The goal of this game is to semi-accurately simulate running your own game development company. You start from scratch, and slowly build your company from scratch. Hire employees, buy new equipment, upgrade your workspace, and more in order to build a game-making empire

Due to the limits of Idle Game Maker, you can obviously not expect that many customization options. However, I tried my very best to make this game as fun and unique as possible within IGM's limitations.

Hope you enjoy!
